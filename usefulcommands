I'd like to share that Ansible can be run on localhost via shell:

ansible all -i "localhost," -c local -m shell -a 'echo hello world'

This could be helpful for simple tasks or for some hands-on learning of Ansible.

This also works. 
 ansible-playbook   -i "localhost," -c local test.yml
 
 The playbook has 127.0.0.1 in hosts. 
 
 But if we omit -i "localhost," it complains 
 


=========
command module example
# Disabling warnings
- name: Using curl to connect to a host via SOCKS proxy (unsupported in uri). Ordinarily this would throw a warning.
  shell: curl --socks5 localhost:9000 http://www.ansible.com
  args:
    warn: False

if ! grep -qs -e "release 6" -e "release 7" /etc/redhat-release; then
  exiterr "This script only supports CentOS/RHEL 6 and 7."
fi
